## Getting Started

There are several branches for various environments (Heroku, Docker, Master (python console)). Pick the branch that you want to pull down and clone it to your machine.
I highly recommend that you use the docker environment since it is the most up to date and easiest to setup.
### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```txt
python 3.6
