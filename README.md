## Getting Started

There are several branches for various environments (Heroku, Docker, Master (python console)). Pick the branch that you want to pull down and clone it to your machine.
I highly recommend that you use the docker environment since it is the most up to date and easiest to setup.
### Starting your own instance of Peribot

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. As long as you have python 3.6 installed you can install the remaining requirements through the requirements.txt file

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then all you need to do is run `sh start.sh`
